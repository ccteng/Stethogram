# Stethogram
Stethogram is a digital stethoscope application working in conjunction with a 3D printed open source attachment based on the GliaX design [1] which allows healthcare providers to listen to patient's heart and lung through a Bluetooth audio device such as AirPods. Stethogram can also record the signal as sound files for later use.

The word Stethogram means "A record of heart sounds. The record may be stored for later comparison with subsequent heart sounds." https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/stethogram
